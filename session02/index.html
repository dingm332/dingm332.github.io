<<p class= "titletext"> Yaheetech 54.5in Cat Tree Tower Condo Furniture Scratch Post for Kittens Pet House Play </p>


<<p class= "subtitletext">Let me tell you about this cat tree right meow</p>
<<p class="subsubtitle">5 stars</p>
<<p>Wow, like this lady never buys me anything then on Christmas morning I wake up to this. . . this THING. I usually get screamed at or sprayed with water when I scratch the furniture but the lady gave me TREATS when I scratched this thing. I wasn't sure about climbing it right away but then this little red dot appeared and moved around, I HAD to chase it up the new thing. When I did, I realized this thing is stable, soft and has tons of places to sleep. The lady seems to be ok with me using it for me, I haven't seen her try and climb it yet. I hope she never does, I love this thing, it's mine.

<<p class="subtitletext">This is a 1 1/2 - 2 glass of wine project...</p>
<<p class="subsubtitle">5 stars</p>
<<p>Which means this wasn't easy nor was it hard to put together if you're used to using instructions with pictures only (which I am becoming used to finally). It takes about an hour to hour and a half for one person counting the frustrating moments where you'll need to stop for a minute and take a sip or two of wine to fortify yourself. So, here's some tips for the ladies and gentlemen that actually read the reviews (like me) to garner some little nuggets of wisdom from those who've come before ourselves. Tip #1: When you've lain out all parts to be sure you have everything prior to assembly and come across pics of the condo boxes that are listed in the parts list, don't panic because you don't see them. You'll only have a small and large sleeve that goes over the boxes that you'll be building (Which you'll see in the beginning instructions on the back). Tip #2: When putting the big box together, pay attention to top and bottom numbers and make sure you line up the two holes on top and bottom (I had to take apart later because I didn't do this) Also, this will be the back of your box when putting the sleeve (plush material) on the finished box. Once you get past the middle level, it's much easier going. So, enjoy your project and your wine (or choice of mood enhancer) and relax when needed. It isn't brain surgery, but, it does have its' moments of madness.</p>

<<p class="subtitletext">Sturdy, soft thick material</p>
<<p class="subsubtitle">4 stars</p>
<<p>So I bought this after looking all over Amazon for a great cat condo that was easy to put together and would be sturdy to withhold an adult cat. When I received it it came in a large thick box. It definitely was heavy but once opened I loved how the parts were numbered, there was an assembly page and the nuts and bolts were all there. Between my husband and I it took us about an hour. So be ready to spend some time putting it together there’s about 20 parts to it and many screws. It helped me to have my husband help but I could have done it alone as well since he helped me fit the last 20 or so minutes. The completed house was tall large and sturdy. While I don’t think the cat will fit the three circle stands the cat does fit in the small cave like areas. He likes the scratching posts and the balls that are attached to the perches. The color is even and the carpet type of cloth is thick and warm. All in all I’m giving it 4/5 stars simply because the cat will not be able to use the three perched. But he’s 3 years old. If I had a kitten they would fit in the perches perfectly. Would I recommend? Yes! Great price and quality product. I hope to have it for many years.</p>

<<p class="subtitletext">Great product for the price your paying!!!!</p>
<<p class="subsubtitle">5 stars</p>
<<p>I gave this product five stars because it is well worth considering how cheap it is.
A lot of people mentioned that it wobbles a lot but after tightening them all to their max it is really sturdy. It rocks a little when he’s shifting his weight on it but that’s to be expected such as how a bed moves when your changing positions.
I consider my cat to be on the larger size but he fits very nicely inside the top house. It was recommended for kittens and medium cats so I was nervous but he has no problem getting in there. He’s 10 years old so he’s not hyper or anything and takes his time getting to the top.
I recently had an issue with a neighbor and had to keep him inside when he’s been an outside cat most of his life. So I was pleased to find something so affordable that would give him a spot in the house to retreat to.</p>
